## Critical Success Factors

1. **Performance**: The system must handle high volumes of traffic and maintain fast loading times, especially for image-heavy features like Virtual Try-On.

2. **Mobile Experience**: All features must be fully functional and optimized for mobile devices, as over 70% of fashion e-commerce traffic is expected to come from mobile.

3. **Seamless Integration**: Custom fashion features must integrate smoothly with the core Medusa.js platform without impacting performance or stability.

4. **User Engagement**: Features like the Style Quiz and Outfit Builder must be intuitive and engaging to maximize user participation and conversion.

5. **Accurate Recommendations**: Size recommendations and style suggestions must be accurate to build trust and reduce returns.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Integration issues with Medusa.js | High | Medium | Perform early proof-of-concept for custom features, maintain close alignment with Medusa.js updates |
| Performance bottlenecks in image processing | High | High | Use scalable cloud services for image processing, implement efficient caching, consider third-party services |
| Data accuracy in size recommendations | Medium | Medium | Collect and analyze actual purchase and return data, implement continuous learning algorithm |
| User adoption of new features | Medium | Low | Conduct user testing during development, create intuitive onboarding experiences |
| Database scaling issues | High | Low | Design database schema for scalability, use indexing, implement query optimization |
